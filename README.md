## R-dissertation-files

#### This repository contains a sample of the code used for the data analysis in my undergraduate dissertation which can be read online here: 
#### https://www.academia.edu/108118146/How_did_Local_Subsistence_Economies_Change_in_Light_of_Increasing_Globalisation_With_the_Emergence_of_the_Silk_Roads?source=swp_share 

#### As this was an individual project it was all originally written in RStudio and stored locally
#### as such in the uploading of these files to GitHub some code may have been lost, 
#### this code is intended to give a sample of how some of the analysis could be reproduced, rather than reflect all of the code that was involved in producing the analysis in the dissertation.
